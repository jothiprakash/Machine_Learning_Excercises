#' @title Show and visualize the steps of feature selection.

#' @description
#' This function prints the steps \code{\link{selectFeatures}} took to find its optimal set
#' of features and the reason why it stopped.
#' It can also print information about all calculations done in each intermediate step.
#'
#' Currently only implemented for sequential feature selection.
#'
#' @template arg_fsres
#' @param reduce [\code{logical(1)}]\cr
#'   Per iteration: Print only the selected feature (or all features that were evaluated)?
#'   Default is \code{TRUE}.
