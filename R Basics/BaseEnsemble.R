# an ensemble of base learners (probably of different learner types) that are some how
# combined and used in combination in the derived class
#
# - we check that baselearners have a certain, unique learner type, unique ids (so we can indes with ids)
#   and set the learner type of the ensemble by default to the type of the baselearners
# - properties is intersection of props of base.learners
# - required packages is union of base.learners packages
# - par.set is join of base.learner par.sets + extra params of derived class
# - all params of base.learners get new name <learnerid>.<paramid> to avoid name clashes
# - predict.type = response by default
# - train and predict we cannot really define, must be done in derived class
