#' @title Featureless classification learner.
#'
#' @description
#' A very basic baseline method which is useful for model comparisons (if you
#' don't beat this, you very likely have a problem).
#' Does not consider any features of the task and only uses the target feature
#' of the training data to make predictions.
#' Using observation weights is currently not supported.
#'
#' Method \dQuote{majority} predicts always the majority class for each new
#' observation. In the case of ties, one randomly sampled, constant class is predicted
#' for all observations in the test set.
#' This method is used as the default. It is very similar to the ZeroR classifier
#' from WEKA (see \url{https://weka.wikispaces.com/ZeroR}). The only difference is
#' that ZeroR always predicts the first class of the tied class values instead
#' of sampling them randomly.
#'
#' Method \dQuote{sample-prior} always samples a random class for each individual test
#' observation according to the prior probabilities observed in the training data.
#'
#' If you opt to predict probabilities, the class probabilities always
#' correspond to the prior probabilities observed in the training data.
