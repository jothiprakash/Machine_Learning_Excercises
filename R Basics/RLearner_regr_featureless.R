#' @title Featureless regression learner.
#'
#' @description
#' A very basic baseline method which is useful for model comparisons (if you
#' don't beat this, you very likely have a problem).
#' Does not consider any features of the task and only uses the target feature
#' of the training data to make predictions.
#' Using observation weights is currently not supported.
#'
#' Methods \dQuote{mean} and \dQuote{median} always predict a constant value
#' for each new observation which corresponds to the observed mean or median of
#' the target feature in training data, respectively.
#'
#' The default method is \dQuote{mean} which corresponds to the ZeroR algorithm
#' from WEKA, see \url{https://weka.wikispaces.com/ZeroR}.
