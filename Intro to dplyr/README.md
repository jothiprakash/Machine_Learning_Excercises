## Introduction to dplyr for Faster Data Manipulation in R

[This tutorial](https://github.com/ujjwalkarn/DataScienceR/blob/master/Intro%20to%20dplyr/dplyr-tutorial.Rmd) is based on Kevin Markham's dplyr tutorial (https://github.com/justmarkham/dplyr-tutorial). He has created a [40-minute video](http://youtu.be/jWjqLW-u3hc) introducing Hadley Wickham's [dplyr](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr) package. 

I have modified his R markdown document and added a few more functions at the end. This can be used along with his video for hands-on coding. I will update this markdown document from time to time, adding even more sample code.

More information about the original tutorial is available on [his excellent blog](http://www.dataschool.io/dplyr-tutorial-for-faster-data-manipulation-in-r/).
